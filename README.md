# Emmy

**Emmy** is a feature-rich terminal emulator designed to be 10x more beautiful and functional than the default macOS terminal. Built on Electron + xterm.js with a hand-tuned Catppuccin Mocha theme. Emmy is everything you wished your terminal was.

## Features

### Productivity
- **Split-Screen Mode** — Two terminals side-by-side. Drag the divider to resize, drop any tab into either pane, close individual panes with the ✕ button.
- **Unlimited Tabs** — Spin up as many named tabs as you need. Each gets its own PTY, timestamps, and history. Rename any tab with a double-click.
- **Command Log** — `⌘⇧L` opens a searchable, time-stamped log of every command you've run, with output previews and one-click jump-to.
- **Output Copy Button** — Every entry in the Command Log has a one-click copy button that grabs clean, formatted output — stripping prompts and terminal noise.
- **Jump to Prompt** — `⌘↑` / `⌘↓` jumps through your scrollback history one command at a time.
- **Scroll to Bottom** — A button appears whenever you scroll up in a busy session, letting you jump back to live output in one click.
- **Prompt Spacing** — A blank line automatically appears between each command's output and the next prompt, making dense output easy to scan.
- **Clickable URLs & Domains** — Every URL (`https://`) and bare domain (`nvidia.com`, `perplexity.ai`) is `Cmd+click`able and opens in your browser.
- **Clickable File Paths** — Any `/absolute` or `./relative` path in output is `Cmd+click`able and opens in Finder.
- **Multi-Line Paste** — Paste a block of commands and Emmy hands them to your shell as a unit, waiting for a single Enter.
- **Tab Drag & Drop** — Drag any session tab and drop it onto a split pane to reassign it instantly.
- **Highlight-to-Delete** — Select text, press backspace to delete exactly that many characters.
- **Font Zoom** — `⌘+` / `⌘−` to scale font size, `⌘0` to reset.
- **GPU Rendering** — WebGL-accelerated text rendering with full Retina support.
- **Screenshot & File Drop** — Drag any file from Finder into the terminal to paste its shell-escaped path.

### Beauty
- **Color Themes** — 6 hand-tuned themes: Catppuccin, Matrix, Francisco, Haze, Mocha, and Monokai. Switch instantly from the titlebar.
- **Frosted Glass UI** — Vibrancy on the sidebar and titlebar that responds to your desktop in real time.
- **Premium Typography** — JetBrains Mono at pixel-perfect sizing with 1.0 line height and zero letter-spacing.
- **Unfocused Split Dimming** — The inactive pane dims back so your focus is always clear.
- **Smooth Animations** — Every transition is eased and timed so Emmy never feels abrupt.
- **Rotating Greetings** — 20+ welcome banners, a fresh one every session.
- **Visual Polish** — Grain overlay, layered shadows, consistent border radii throughout.
